  \"This course examines in some detail how a computer works. To prepare for this study,
    students will learn the basics of binary arithmetic, data representation, along with
    propositional and predicate logic. The major hardware components of a computer,
    including processors (CPUs), memory (RAM), storage and other peripheral devices will
    be examined in some detail. Computer software will also be studied. The process of
    program translation and execution will be outlined. Students will learn machine
    language and learn to write and run simple assembly language programs. Operating
    system functions and the organization of file systems will be studied.\"\

The students of this course have the following responsibilities: read assigned readings\
before lecture, attend lecture, complete homework assignments, take in class quizzes, \
take exams, and possibly complete a project. The final grade consists of:\
\
- **Quizzes: 10% total.** There should be a quiz approximately once per week. For blackboard\
  quizzes you will be allowed to use your notes for the quiz, any other type of quiz, use\
  of notes or Internet or crib sheets will be decided on a case-by-case basis.\
- **Homework: 25% total.** There will be a homework assignment most weeks. The total of all\
  homework assignments is worth 25% of the final grade. If you turn in the assignment late,\
  I may grade it at 80%. Homework turned in after I've discussed the assignment in class\
  WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. NOTE: you may ask me to look over an assignment before it is due\
  and I may help by pointing out mistakes that need correction and provide other feedback.\
- **Exams: 50% total.** We will have two exams. A mid-term worth ~100 points, and a final\
  exam worth ~150 points.\
- **Class Attendance/Participation: 15% total.** Attendance will be taken at the beginning\
  of each class.",
